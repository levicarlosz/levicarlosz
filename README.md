### üëã Hey, I'm Levi Carlos! 
I have been passionate about technology since I was 17, and currently, at 19, I am studying Systems Analysis and Development at UDF. Alongside my studies, I have been dedicating myself to learning about cybersecurity, with a particular interest in becoming a SOC Analyst (Security Operations Center). I am deepening my knowledge in areas such as threat detection, incident response, and security monitoring, while also improving my development skills in Angular and Java. My goal is to combine my love for technology with my drive for cybersecurity, and I am looking for opportunities to grow, learn, and contribute meaningfully in this field.
