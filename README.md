### Hey, I'm Levi Carlos! 👋
I have been a programming enthusiast since I was 17, and currently, at 19, I am studying Systems Analysis and Development at UDF. I have always had a passion for technology, and I am deepening my knowledge in Angular and Java to expand my skills in development. Additionally, I have a strong interest in cybersecurity. I am looking for opportunities that allow me to learn, grow, and contribute in a meaningful way.
